# Library Management System
This is a basic library management system with admin, users, issue requests and everything included based on MVC architecture. 
# Requirements 
It needds PHP interpreter, MYSQL server and composer to run. It's based on Toro made by anandkunal. Find the repository:  https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP
# Installation
Clone the repository and cd into it. Then run  
``` ./setup.sh```
in your terminal to setup everything..  
# Usage
Run the server on local host. First cd into public directory and then run: 
```php -S localhost:PORT```
On whatever PORT number you want to run it on. 
For the sake of convenience, an admin already exists with the username as admin and password as password. New users and admins can be registered as soon as the server is started, however new admins need to be approved and the information about username and password has been provided above for the same.
